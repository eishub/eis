# The Environment Interface

The environment interface framework provides support for connecting agents to an environment. By implementing this interface (see the wiki for a how-to-guide), agents developed using any platform that supports EIS can connect to the environment.

## Releases

Releases of the EIS interface can be found [here](https://github.com/eishub/eis/releases). You can also find releases in [eishub's maven repository](https://github.com/eishub/mvn-repo/tree/master/eishub/eis).

## Building

The environment interface project uses [Apache's Maven](http://maven.apache.org). Run "mvn package" to compile classes and generate jar-file.
