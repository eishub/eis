/**
 * Annotation for methods that generate a percept. The method must not take any
 * parameters but is allowed to return any value for which a
 * {@link Java2Parameter} translator has been registered.
 * <p>
 * {@link AsPercept} tags have four parameters:
 * <ol>
 * <li>name: the name of the percept to be returned
 * <li>multiplePercepts: true when the percept function returns a List of
 * (translatable) Objects, and each of the elements in the list should give
 * another percept. E.g. "on" returning [1,2] gives the percepts {on(1), on(2)}.
 * <li>multipleArguments: true when the percept function returns a List of
 * (translatable) objects, and each of the elements of the list should be put as
 * another argument in the percept. E.g., "on" returning [1,2] gives the percept
 * on(1,2).
 * <li>filter. One of Filter.Type.ALWAYS, ONCE, ONCHANGE or ONCHANGENEG.
 * <li>event. True when the percepts are event based and the results from all
 * calls to this method should be passed to the agent.
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>
 * It is possible to combine multiplePercepts and multipleArguments, in which
 * case the function should return a list of lists. The outside list is used for
 * the multiplePercepts, the inner for the multipleArguments. E.g., "on"
 * returning [[1,2],[3,4,5]] then results in the percepts {on(1,2),on(3,4,5)}.
 * </p>
 *
 * The filter type determines the way percepts are filtered before sending out
 * through EIS:
 * <TABLE border='1'>
 * <caption>Filter types</caption> <thead>
 * <tr>
 * <th>filter name</th>
 * <th>full name</th>
 * <th>behaviour</th>
 * </tr>
 * </thead> <tbody>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ALWAYS</td>
 * <td>send always</td>
 * <td>send percepts every round</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ONCE</td>
 * <td>send one time</td>
 * <td>send percepts only the first round</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ON_CHANGE</td>
 * <td>send when changed</td>
 * <td>send percept(s), but only if any of the percepts changes</td>
 * </tr>
 * <tr>
 * <td>ON_CHANGE_NEG</td>
 * <td>send on change using 'not'</td>
 * <td>if percept p is new then send p; if percept p was removed and
 * (multiplePercepts=true or (multiple=false and p became null)) then send
 * not(p)</td>
 * </tr>
 * </tbody>
 * </table>
 * <p>
 * <em> Important: </em>the {@link AbstractEnvironment} compares old and new
 * percepts based on the {@link Object} that is returned, not based on the
 * translator result. This is to avoid extra overhead of translation. This means
 * that you <em>must return</em> a static (non-changing) object as percept, and
 * that that percept object must have a functioning equals.
 * </p>
